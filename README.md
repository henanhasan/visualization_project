# PISA 2012 Data Exploration & Insights
## by Hanan Hasan


## Overview
>This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the PISA 2012 dataset, focusing on student behaviors, parental influence, and academic performance. The data exploration (Part I notebook) dives into several facets of the dataset, shedding light on the dynamics between various factors and their potential influence on a student's academic success. The explanatory slide deck (Part II outcome) encapsulates key insights derived from the analysis, providing a cohesive narrative on the overarching findings.


## Dataset Overview
>The data consisted of countries and scores of approximately 700,000 students. The attributes included the parental and school environmental factors, as well as additional measurements such as timespendture outside school,and Truancies of skipping classes. I have taken a random sample of 10000 entries from it as it was a large file Aand difficult to work on in f=different environments. as well as 10 data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information.

## Summary of Main Findings
> -Study Time vs. Performance: More hours spent studying doesn't always translate to better academic performance. This was notably evident in students from the US and Indonesia.
-Parental Influence: In non-OECD countries, students with parents holding Level 1 or lower educational credentials surprisingly outperformed their peers.
-Digital Influence: Patterns of computer usage varied across countries, with students in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Bulgaria predominantly spending more time on computers.
-Gender Dynamics: Male students had a slight edge in performance, even though females dedicated more time to homework.
-Teacher-Student Relationship: The bond between students and teachers stood out as a significant predictor of academic performance.
-Country-wise Analysis: Countries like the USA and Indonesia exhibited higher scores, while others, despite having strong student-teacher relationships, lagged.
-Holistic Factors: Academic success is a culmination of multiple factors â€“ parental education, student-teacher relationships, truancy rates, and personal diligence.
-General Observations: The majority of students had a positive relationship with their teachers and displayed commitment to their academic responsibilities.

## Key Insights for Explanatory for Presentation
>-The counterintuitive trend between study time and academic performance, especially in countries like the US and Indonesia.
-The surprising impact of parental education levels on student performance in non-OECD countries.
-Diverse patterns of computer usage and their potential correlation (or lack thereof) with academic scores.
-The pivotal role of student-teacher relationships in shaping academic outcomes.
-A comparative analysis of academic performance across key countries, revealing disparities and potential areas of improvement.

## Steps Taken During Data Exploration (Part I Notebook)
>-Data Loading & Preliminary Assessment: Loaded the PISA 2012 dataset and conducted an initial assessment to understand its structure and content.
-Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and standardized data formats for uniformity.
-Univariate Exploration: Analyzed individual variables to understand their distribution and characteristics.
-Bivariate Exploration: Explored relationships between two variables to uncover potential correlations or trends.
-Multivariate Exploration: Delved into interactions among multiple variables to gain deeper insights and complex relationships.
-Key Observations: After each exploration step, key observations were noted, setting the stage for further analysis and conclusions.

## Conclusion
>
The PISA 2012 data exploration provided a comprehensive view of the various factors influencing student performance. By understanding these dynamics, educators, policymakers, and stakeholders can implement effective strategies to enhance educational outcomes globally.
