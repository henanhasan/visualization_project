# PISA 2012 Data Wrangling

This repository contains instructions and code for performing data wrangling on the 'pisa2012' CSV file. The goal of this process is to clean and format the data, remove rows with missing values, and correct any writing and typing errors. Below are the steps to follow for data wrangling:

## Data Description

The 'pisa2012' CSV file contains data related to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012. The dataset includes various attributes related to student performance, demographics, and educational factors.

## Data Wrangling Steps

### Step 1: Data Loading

1.1. Ensure you have Python and the pandas library installed.

1.2. Load the 'pisa2012' CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using the following code:

```
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('pisa2012.csv')

```
### Step 2: Data Formatting

2.1. Examine the data for any formatting errors, such as inconsistent date formats or numeric representations. Identify columns that may contain incorrect data types.

2.2. Correct formatting errors as needed. For example, you may convert date columns to the appropriate date format and ensure numeric columns have the correct data types.

Step 3: Missing Values
3.1. Identify columns that contain missing values (NaN or empty values).

3.2. Remove rows with missing values using the dropna() method. Replace missing values with appropriate values if necessary.

```
# Remove rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```
Step 4: Writing and Typing Errors
4.1. Examine the data for writing and typing errors, such as typos or inconsistencies in categorical values.

4.2. Correct any writing and typing errors in the dataset. This may involve standardizing category names, fixing typos, or reformatting text.

Step 5: Save the Cleaned Data
5.1. Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file to preserve the changes made during the data wrangling process.

```
# Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file
df.to_csv('cleaned_pisa2012.csv', index=False)

```
Repository Contents
'pisa2012.csv': The original CSV file containing the PISA 2012 data.
'cleaned_pisa2012.csv': The cleaned CSV file with formatting errors, missing values, and writing/typing errors addressed.

Follow the steps outlined above to wrangle the 'pisa2012' data file, and refer to the 'cleaned_pisa2012.csv' file for the cleaned dataset.

For any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.

You should replace 'pisa2012.csv' with the actual file name if it's different, and make sure you save the cleaned data as 'cleaned_pisa2012.csv' or your preferred name. Additionally, ensure you have the necessary Python and pandas dependencies installed to perform the data wrangling steps.
